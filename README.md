# I'm Evan Armstrong
## Author, Programmer, Machine learning practitioner

Second-year CS student, doing ML and occasionally actually studying. I recently made MythoMakise and got #13 on the Ayumi LLM leaderboard! And then Weicon changed the leaderboard and now my highest model is only #34 ðŸ˜¢ but eh whatever my models are still improving.

Currently I'm working on solviong the lack-of-data problem that open source faces, using something that (if it works) will make Augmental look like a party trick.

If you have an opportunity that will give me an excuse to drop out and do AI full-time, please oblige me.

Find me on Discord as @Heralax !
