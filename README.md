# I'm Evan Armstrong
## Author and Programmer

Salutations! I'm a University Student @ UBC, the author of the book Humanity Endures, and a programmer who has worked at Leanpub. I am presently occupied with first year, but always looking for opportunities to improve my ability. 
Message me and let's be hacker friends! If you have any cool things you're working on, do let me know... and if you want to scream at me about any of my code, I'm always open to feedback.

I aspire to be a Super Hacka. If you get that reference, you are a cultured human.
