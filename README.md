# I'm Evan Armstrong
## Author, Programmer, Machine learning practitioner, AI Consultant

Want to build and deploy a custom LLM that understands the knowledge (or style) of your business? Let's have a (non-salesy, no-stakes) chat about your needs! [https://calendly.com/evanpeterarmstrong/discovery-call](https://calendly.com/evanpeterarmstrong/discovery-call). I want to help your AI work succeed. You can also DM or email me! evanpeterarmstrong@gmail.com

I also made the data generation tool, Augmentoolkit! It's since received many updates based on my consulting practice and user feedback. I've made a variety of LLMs such as Llama-3-VerusGPT, the Augmental and MythoMakise RP LLMs, and more.

Consulting full time. Also working on this courses+community+calls [group for learning AI as a devleoper](https://www.skool.com/placeholder-ai-group-name-1872)!
