I recently finished the first version of Augmentoolkit, which is an easy way for anyone to generate instruct-tuning data, using local LLMs, running on their own hardware! I also made Augmental and MythoMakise a while ago. One of them reached #13 on the Ayumi LLM leaderboard at some point!

If you have an opportunity that will give me an excuse to drop out of University and do AI full-time, please oblige me.
