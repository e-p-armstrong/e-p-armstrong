Need help making your API calls cheaper and more consistent? I've been prompt engineering nonstop for a long time now, I can probably help you. DM or email me! evanpeterarmstrong@gmail.com

I made the data generation tool, Augmentoolkit! It's since received updates to use APIs and the Aphrodite engine. I also made the Augmental and MythoMakise LLMs a while ago. One of them reached #13 on the Ayumi LLM leaderboard at some point!

Working @ Leanpub part-time, whenever I'm not consulting.

Find me on Discord as @Heralax !
